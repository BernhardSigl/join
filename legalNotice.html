                <p><strong>Liability for Content</strong><br><br>
                    The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the
                    accuracy,
                    completeness and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
                    content on
                    these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) under the general laws.
                    According to §§
                    8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
                    information
                    or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
                    use of
                    information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible
                    from the
                    time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. If we become aware of any such legal violations, we
                    will remove
                    the content immediately.<br><br><strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
                    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no
                    influence.
                    Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
                    operator of
                    the linked pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were
                    checked for
                    possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time
                    of linking.
                    However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
                    evidence of
                    a violation of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links
                    immediately.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
                    The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright
                    law. The
                    reproduction, editing, distribution and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require
                    the
                    written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only
                    permitted for
                    private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator,
                    the
                    copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such.
                    Should you
                    nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become
                    aware of any
                    infringements, we will remove such content immediately.<br><br><strong>Data
                        Protection</strong><br><br>
                    The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal information. As far as
                    personal data
                    (e.g., name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a
                    voluntary basis
                    as far as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express
                    consent.<br>
                    We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can have
                    security gaps. A
                    complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br>
                    The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for
                    sending
                    unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of
                    the pages
                    expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of
                    advertising
                    information, such as spam emails.
