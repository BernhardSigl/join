            <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
                project management tool. Here, we'll
                provide an overview of what <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you and
                how to use it.</p>
            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p><span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
                by a group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
            <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span>
                leverages the principles of kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                exercise and is not intended for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
                guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span
                    class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span>.
            </p>
            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span>:</p>
            <ul class="ul-edited">
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h3-edited"><strong>Exploring the board</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p-edited">When you log in to <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span>, you'll find a
                        default board. This board represents your
                        project and
                        contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h3-edited"><strong>Creating contacts</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p-edited">In <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                        collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                        "Contacts" section,
                        click on "New contact" and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
                        assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h3-edited"><strong>Adding sards</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p-edited">Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                        individual
                        tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task
                        details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h3-edited"><strong>Moving cards</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p-edited">As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board
                        by dragging and
                        dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h3-edited"><strong>Deleting cards</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p-edited">Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete
                        it. Deleting a card
                        will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                        action is irreversible.</p>
                    <p class="p-edited">Remember that using <span class="fontBrighterBlue">Join</span> effectively
                        requires consistent updates from you and
                        your team to ensure
                        the board reflects the current state of your project.</p>
